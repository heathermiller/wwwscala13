Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the standard [ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference
style](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author) (10pt format). Regular
research papers must not exceed 10 pages, tool demonstration papers
and short papers must not exceed 4 pages. "Tool Demos" and "Short
Papers" should be marked as such with those words in the title at time
of submission.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the
workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration
papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is
expected. Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the [advice for
authoring research papers](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author)
before submitting. The workshop chairs welcome any inquiries about the
authoring advice.

A week before the paper submission deadline, authors have to submit a
short plain-text abstract via EasyChair (see below).


## Student Talks

In addition to regular papers and tool demos, we also solicit short
*student talks* by PhD students. A student talk is not accompanied by
a paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in
plain text). Student talks are about 5 minutes long, presenting
ongoing or completed research related to Scala, or announcing a
project that would be of interest to the Scala community.  "Student
Talks" should be marked as such with those words in the title at time
of submission.
