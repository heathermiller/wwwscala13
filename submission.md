title: Submission Information
---

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
formatted using the standard [ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference
style](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author) (10pt format). Regular
research papers must not exceed 10 pages, tool demonstration papers
and short papers must not exceed 4 pages. "Tool Demos" and "Short
Papers" should be marked as such with those words in the title at time
of submission.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the
workshop and present the work. In the case of tool demonstration
papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is
expected. Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the [advice for
authoring research papers](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author)
before submitting. The workshop chairs welcome any inquiries about the
authoring advice.

_Note:_ "Short Papers" differ from "Tool Demos" in that "Short Papers" are
approached as short research papers. "Short Papers" are expected to carry some
new insights or contribution, and to compare with related work, as with any
normal research paper. They're simply shorter versions of full research
papers. "Tool Demos" on the other hand are about showcasing a well-developed,
well-documented tool, live, before the workshop. "Tool Demo"s' corresponding
papers are meant to contain an overview of the tool and methodology for the
tool's use. Tool demo papers are less concerned about proving new research
insights, or thoroughly comparing with related work. The Scala Workshop PC
will approach Tool Demos in the same way as the PEPM Workshop PC, detailed in
[PEPM's Tool Paper Evaluation Criteria](http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM13/ToolPaperAdvice)

A week before the paper submission deadline, authors have to submit a
short plain-text abstract via EasyChair (see below).


### Student Talks

In addition to regular papers and tool demos, we also solicit short
*student talks* by bachelor/master/PhD students. A student talk is not accompanied by
a paper (it is sufficient to submit a short abstract of the talk in
plain text). Student talks are 5-10 minutes long, presenting
ongoing or completed research related to Scala, or announcing a
project that would be of interest to the Scala community.  "Student
Talks" should be marked as such with those words in the title at time
of submission.
